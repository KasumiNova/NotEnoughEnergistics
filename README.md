# Not Enough Energistics
NotEnoughEnergistics-1.12.2 is an improved version of [Just Enough Energistics](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-enough-energistics-jee)

This mod replaces AE2's default JEI integration for the Pattern Terminal.

By default, AE2 forces the player to either have the necessary items for a recipe in their personal inventory or in their ME network.

This mod removes that functionality and allows the player to use JEI's transfer system (click [+] button) to create patterns whether the player possesses the items required by the recipe.


## Features

- Automatically switch the mode of PatternTerminal.
- Combine like stacks in processing patterns.
- Support Processing Pattern Terminal(16 -> 4 mode).
- Allow you to add item blackList and item priority list, if item in them, it will not be transferred / transfer it first.
- Allow you to add mod priority list,if the mod's has this item,it will be use first.
- You can use the mouse wheel to change the Pattern item input/output amount.
